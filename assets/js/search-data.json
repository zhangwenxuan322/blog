            "content": "Recently I’m learning a course, Practical Deep Learning for Coders. Shout-out to fast.ai, they provides valuable neural nets course, resourses and dev tools. This gender revcognizer is a simple practice inspired by the first two lessons that i recently learned. Using fastai library. . . At fist, I used bing image search api collect data. But when i reviewed the data, I found those images were far from my actually needs. What i need is human face images, but most results contain many irrelevant elements like cars, trees, comics… Some images have more than one person. Technically, i can use some face cropping tools pretreat data, but as a beginner, i try to experience the whole process fist. So i found Gender Classification Dataset from kaggle, and use it as my training and validation dataset. . . Dataloader and data augmentation . genders = DataBlock( blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock), get_items=get_image_files, splitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2, seed=42), get_y=parent_label, item_tfms=Resize(128)) genders = genders.new(item_tfms=RandomResizedCrop(128, min_scale=0.5), batch_tfms=aug_transforms(mult=2)) dls = genders.dataloaders(path) dls.valid.show_batch(max_n=8, nrows=2, unique=True) . Train model . learn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet18, metrics=error_rate) learn.fine_tune(4) . Test model . . Thoughts . Data collecting is more challenging than i expected, and it can actually affect my training results. Biased data could cause ethical issues. .",
